### **1. The Turning Point: How I Won with Linux** 🚀  

I didn’t switch to Linux because it was trendy. I switched because I was **fed up with limitations**.  

It all started in my **first year of computer science** at the IUT of Parakou. A classmate had an insane desktop setup. It looked like a hacker's dream. When I asked, he casually said,  
💬 _"Oh, that's just Kali Linux."_  

That was the first time I saw an OS **that wasn’t Windows**. Back in 2023, Windows 10 was the standard, and I never questioned it. But after that encounter, my curiosity kicked in.  

I installed **Kali Linux on VirtualBox** and started tinkering. The **command line immediately hooked me** it was **powerful, direct, efficient**. I even **avoided the GUI**, trying to do everything in CLI. It felt like hacking the system, **but for real**.  

But I had a problem:  
🛑 **I was still stuck on Windows for coding, testing, and studying.**  

Then, one day, **Windows broke me**.  

I was working on a **C project**, but I couldn't type `<` and `>` properly. Instead of just pressing two keys, I had to either **open the on-screen keyboard** or memorize awkward combinations (`Alt+60`, `Alt+62`). **Ridiculous.**  

Frustrated, I searched for solutions and came across a Linux dev’s tutorial. Out of curiosity, I tested his setup and discovered:  
**Shift + Alt + W for `<` and Shift + Alt + X for `>`**.  

That was it.  
💥 **The moment I decided I would never code on Windows again.**  

I started using **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**, then **dual-booted Linux**, until I finally wiped Windows completely. And I’ve never looked back.

### **2. The Frustrations I Left Behind** ❌  

❌ **No control** – Windows and macOS dictate how you use your system. I wanted **freedom**.  
❌ **Performance issues** – Windows slows down with every update. Linux stays **fast and efficient**.  
❌ **Bloatware & background processes** – I hated unnecessary software eating up resources.  
❌ **Forced updates** – Windows decides when to restart. **Linux lets me be in control.**  

Switching to Linux wasn’t just about the OS. It was about taking **full ownership of my computing experience**.

### **3. What I Gained with Linux** 🏆  

✅ **Speed & efficiency** – My system runs like a dream. No lag, no random slowdowns.  
✅ **Total customization** – Everything is built to fit **my workflow perfectly**.  
✅ **Privacy & security** – No forced telemetry. No hidden data collection.  
✅ **A hacker mindset** – Learning Linux **taught me how computers actually work**.  

Linux didn’t just change my OS. It changed **how I think** about technology.

### **4. My Linux Journey: From Chaos to Mastery** 🛤️  

I didn’t master Linux overnight. I **broke my system countless times**, reinstalled everything, and experimented like crazy.  

Here’s how my Linux evolution went:  

- **Kali Linux** – My first experience, but too niche for daily use.  
- **Ubuntu WSL & MX Linux** – First real steps into the Linux world.  
- **Linux Mint** – User-friendly, but too bloated for me.  
- **Arch Linux** – Full control, but installation was brutal.  
- **Void Linux** – My final choice: **fast, minimal, and powerful**.  

Every mistake I made **taught me something new**.

### **5. The Game-Changing Discoveries** 💡  

💡 **Tiling Window Managers** (i3, bspwm) → My workflow became lightning fast.  
💡 **Package Management** – Learning Pacman (Arch), APT (Debian), XBPS (Void).  
💡 **Dotfiles & Minimalist Configs** – Customizing my environment to perfection.  

Each of these **boosted my productivity and efficiency** beyond what I thought was possible.

### **6. Why Void Linux Won Me Over** 🏆  

💨 **Super lightweight** – No unnecessary services slowing me down.  
⚡ **XBPS package manager** – Faster and simpler than APT or Pacman.  
🚀 **No systemd** – More control over my init system.  
🔄 **Rolling release** – Always up to date without breaking my setup.  

Void Linux isn’t for everyone. But for **power users who want simplicity and speed**, it’s unbeatable.

### **7. Why You Should Consider Linux in 2025** 📅  

💡 **Stop depending on Big Tech companies** controlling your system.  
💡 **Get real performance gains** – No forced obsolescence.  
💡 **Own your data** – No background tracking, telemetry, or forced cloud sync.  
💡 **Join an open-source revolution** – A community built on collaboration.  

Windows and macOS are **products**.  
Linux is a **philosophy**.

### **8. My Advice for Linux Newcomers** 🎯  

🟢 **Start with the right distro** – Ubuntu/Mint if you're new, Arch/Void if you love tinkering.  
🟢 **Learn the terminal** – `cd`, `ls`, `mv`, `grep` will change your life.  
🟢 **Break things & learn** – Don't be afraid to experiment.  
🟢 **Join a community** – Reddit, Discord, Linux forums are goldmines of knowledge.  
🟢 **Optimize your workflow** – Neovim, Tmux, Fish/Zsh, and dotfiles will take you to the next level.

### **9. Conclusion: More Than Just an OS** 🔥  

Linux **isn’t just software** it’s a **way of thinking**. It forces you to **understand** your system, customize it, and push it to its full potential.  

💡 If you’re tired of **closed ecosystems, slow performance, and restrictions**, Linux is your way out.
